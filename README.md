# ETL_Project_Commodities

Commodity prices are believed to be a leading indicator of inflation. On about August 27, 2020 “Jerome H. Powell, the chair of the Federal Reserve, announced a major shift in how the central bank guides the economy, signaling it will make job growth pre-eminent and will not raise interest rates to guard against coming inflation just because the unemployment rate is low.

“It seems like a pretty subtle shift to most normal human beings,” said Janet L. Yellen, the former Fed Chair. But “most of the Fed’s history has revolved around keeping inflation under control. This really does reflect a decisive recognition that we're in a very different environment.”

# Project Scope:
This project entails extracting, loading and transforming data on Commodities (silver, gold, energy), crypto (a correlation to inflation) and consumer price index (CPI)

# Observation:
As shown in the scatterplot and linear regression, there is a strong correlation between energy price and CPI. while the other commodities show stronger correlation over the 10 year time period, they don't consistently correlate to CPI as energy price has

# Data Sources:
1) Silver CSV - Investing.com 
2) Gold CSV - Investing.com
3) Energy - Investpy Python - library for investing.com
